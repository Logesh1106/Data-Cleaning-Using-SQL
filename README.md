# Data-Cleaning-Using-SQL

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing Nashville housing data using SQL. 

The data was obtained from the Metro Nashville Open Data Portal and includes information on residential properties such as their location, assessed values, and owner details. 

The project involves identifying and handling missing values, removing duplicate records, and addressing inconsistencies in the data. SQL queries are used to extract and manipulate the data to create a clean and organized dataset for further analysis. 

The final dataset provides an accurate representation of Nashville's residential properties and can be used for a variety of purposes, including market analysis, property valuation, and real estate research.
